# MAT219: Data Science Midterm and Final Projects
In the MAT219: Data Science I course, the core focus was to develop essential skills to effectively analyze and manipulate data using the R programming language and the Tidyverse ecosystem. The course covered a wide range of topics, including data import, cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis. Emphasis was placed on the strong potential of Tidyverse functions such as dplyr, ggplot2, and tidyr to streamline data workflows and produce insightful visualizations. Throughout the course, students were encouraged to gain hands-on experience by working with real-world datasets, which allowed me to apply the concepts learned in class to practical data analysis tasks. 

**Midterm**: I recreated a website focusing on the delivery of school shooting statistics in HTML using real world datasets, and applying R Tidyverse functions to manipulate and visualize the given data sets that are shown in the site. 

**Final Project:** In the final project for the class, I was given the freedom of choosing a topic/dataset that interested me and conducted data manipulation/analysis on that topic's gathered datasets. I chose to do an analysis on "The Office" TV show; I found datasets from Kaggle.com, which I used to compose my project. I focused on gaining insight on the show's most popular seasons/episodes and looked for reasons why they had so much popularity. I also investagted if there was the rate of popularity of comedy lines between different characters of the show. An analysis of the datasets provided me with an opportunity to use various data science techniques that I have learned in class to gain deeper insights of the show's popularity.

To break down the final project directory: 

```the_office_series.csv``` and ```the-office_lines.csv``` were the datasets used.

"MAT219 Final Project.pdf" showcases and walks through the entire analysis process, including the R scripts.

"MAT219 Final Presentation.pptx" is the presentation given to the entire class that summarizes the pdf version in a more entertaining and visual way.
