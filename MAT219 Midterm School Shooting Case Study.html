<p>Question: “We could of used the str_replace() function from the stringr package to replace the value for the last row. This function would directly change the value of “85 deaths” to “4+deaths”, but this would not be as reproducible. Why is that?” My answer: str_replace() is not be adaptable to updated data. case_when() will use the value in “Killed” to create/update the “deaths_per_event” value. str_replace() does not have this ability.</p>

<p>Question opportunity: Let’s take a minute to test your knowledge about flexdashboard basics:</p>
<p>How do we create multiple pages? How do we create multiple columns? How do we create multiple tabs? How do we start creating a dashboard? How do we enable our dashboard to be interactive?</p>
<p>My answer: multiple pages: == multiple columns: — multiple tabs: {.tabset} with — creating a dashboard: R markdown with ‘output: flexdashboard::flexdashboard’ enabling interactivity: add ‘runtime:shiny’ to YAML</p>
